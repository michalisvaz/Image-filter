# Image-filter

This project was done for the university course "Computer Programming in C++". We implemented some filters for ppm images including:

* Blurring Filters
* Linear Filters
* Gamma Filters
* Laplace Filters
* Black and White Filter
* Image Rotation Filter
* Image Reversion Filter
* Color reduction Filter

The first four filters were part of the assignment and the other four were extras chosen by us.

Some important C++ knowledge we earned during this project includes the use of pointers, object-oriented programming in C++ and operator overloading. We also learned to properly use header files and to create and use our own libraries with gcc/g++ compiler.

My partner in this project was Vasilis Ballas ([@BLM3826](https://github.com/BLM3826)).
